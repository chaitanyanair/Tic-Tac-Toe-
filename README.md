# Tic-Tac-Toe-
1. This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game to be played between two players on the same machine. 
2. One of the players will be asked to choose a marker 'X' or 'O' and the other player will be assigned the other marker automatically. 
3. When they are ready to play, each player can choose the position at which she can place her marker alternately.
4. Once the board is full, we check if the game is won (by whom) or tied.
5. After these results, players will be asked if they want to play another game and we start with Step 2.
